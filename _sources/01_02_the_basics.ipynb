To begin, though, let's start with the basics. Below we have a dictionary. A good way to think of this dictionary is as an Excel Spreadsheet. Each key in the dictionary is a column and its value is a list which contains each cell in that column. We will see an example of a two-column dataset below, but for now let's work with the single column dataset, \"names\". In this column, we have a list of 6 names."

This means adding columns, deleting columns, performing permutations on data in columns, etc. We are going to cover all these things throughout this textbook. For now, let's start with the basics. Imagine we got the names of individuals from one source and their ages from another. We now need to add those ages into our DataFrame. We can approach the DataFrame as something like a dictionary here. We can add a column by creating it with df4\\[\"ages\"\\]. This allows us to make that equal to the new data. The command below essentially adds a column to our DataFrame. Let's execute the command and print it off."
