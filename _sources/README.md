This repository holds my forthcoming JupyterBook on Pandas. It is meant to function as a quick introduction to Pandas for non-specialists, or those new to Python. It presumes that the reader understands the basic data structures in Python, e.g. lists, dictionaries, etc. It also presumes that you have a rough understanding of Python objects. Beyond that, I do not expect any other knowledge. When complete, this JupyterBook will be available at pandas.pythonhumanities.com. I expect to have the first draft complete by August 2021.
